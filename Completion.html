      <td>Terraria isn't really a game that ends, you can beat the final boss however many times you want. You can beat any of the bosses as many times as you'd like. You can even create new worlds and you can still take your character with all of your items with you. Beating terraria isn't the end of the game. You can beat it 100 more times and it will be different every time.
