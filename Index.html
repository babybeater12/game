      <td>Terraria is an open world sandbox videogame. One of the most popular genres. People often compare it to Minecraft because of its blocky graphics. However, They are very different in every other way. Terraria is a 2d game which means you can only move in a two dimensional plane.
       The reason being is so that the creators can add a lot of different items/entities.
        This makes the game incredibly long and hard to beat, but it has a lot more things to do. </td>
